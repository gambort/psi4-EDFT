Scientific:

* The code does not have deal very well with symmetries, which causes
  issues in some cases - working on it!

* Double excitations should not be reported - the code is there but
  the theory is not necessarily correct

Technical:

* Sometimes you need to delete the .clean files from your folder or
  run the code twice - this seems to be a psi4 bug

* Density fitting is not implemented for range-separation so
  conventional hybrids become much faster after a certain point

* The DFT xc energy calculations do not seem to be parallelised
  which makes them a time-limiting step for smaller systems
